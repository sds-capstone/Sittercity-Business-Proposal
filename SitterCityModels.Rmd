##Assessing Conditions

Logistic regression on:
 being in college/education level at categorical level
 
```{r}
df <- na.omit(df)
```


##Linearity

```{r}
library(performance)
library(see)

price_mileage_model <- lm(Price ~ Mileage, data = AccordPrice)
linearity_check <- check_model(price_mileage_model, check="linearity",
                              panel=FALSE
                              )
plot(linearity_check, data=price_mileage_model)
```
##ANOVA

##
```{r}
##Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the price minimum for sitters based on their level of college education.

##Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the price minimum for sitters based on their level of college education.
