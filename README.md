The Sittercity data capstone project was built by analyzing data provided by the data sponsor, taking us to act as data consultants. We then took on the mission of proposing a business idea to help their company alleviate the decrease in their premium subscription rate.

Data files: 
sittercity_EDA: Refers to the qmd file where the first exploratory data analysis was conducted. 
Sitters.qmd: This is the qmd where the actual analysis and cleaning of data was conducted to be then taken and read into Tableau.
